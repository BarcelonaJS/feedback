I enjoyed giving the talk last week. Unfortunately my vocal delivery was a bit pasty, I'm wondering if there's an option to explore using a wireless microphone?

Another nice to have would be to have the talks livestreamed/recorded as they were when they were in Forward's offices. If you like, I could put you in touch with my current workplace (Streamcast.io) about the potential to livestream and record the events.

Thanks again for having me at LNUG, and I look forward to the next one.
